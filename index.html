	<h1>The causes and effects of climate change</h1>
  	<p>
   For this stop motion project me and my friends are explaing how climte change is affecting our world badly. We have two characters who are Earth man and Oil guy. They fight against each other but Earth man is slowly giving up but he doesn't. The causes for climate isn't just oil it can also be burning processes, fossil fuels, and coal. Here is the video on how me and my classmates explain how bad climate change is.
